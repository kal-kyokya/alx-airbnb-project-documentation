# Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities

## Objective
Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

## Instructions
* Based on the features and functionalities previously identified, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.
* The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.
* Export the diagram as a PNG file as data-flow.png and store it this directory.
